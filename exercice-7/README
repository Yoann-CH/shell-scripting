We use the same script that the exercice-6 to begin that we put on an if when there is not an argument with the function -z.After, in the else we use the an if and -z when there is not 2 argurments.If that is the case, we go to the folder documents with cd and we create the folder with the same name of the first argument and we use -e if it already exists.We put the same folders and files of the documents in this folder.To finish, if there is a second argument we use echo with the message "Usage: ./my_ansible_advanced.sh [username]".
